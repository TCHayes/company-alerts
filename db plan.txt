// Will I clear out the server currentCompanyMap articles x times per day?


MongoDB will have only one, small collection:
  Users Collection Document
  {
    userId: 23432432,
    watchedCompanies: [
      "AMD",
      "Apple",
      "Amazon",
      "Tesla",
      "Google",
      "Exxon"
    ],
                        //users can pick if they want email/text alerts for neg or pos news
    textAlerts: true,   //for MVP, alerts will be set to 85% pos/neg for texts
    emailAlerts: true   //for MVP, alerts will be set to 70% pos/neg for emails
  }


On server startup, access users DB collection, and create server cache (Go map)
  to keep track of which companies each user is watching:
  currentCompanyMap = {
    userID: {
      companies: []Companies
    }
  }

Within the Companies object in the server CurrentCompanyMap, each entry will look like:
Amazon: [
          {
            sentiment: 76,                  //NOT SURE HOW/WHEN TO SET THIS

            author: "Taylor Hatmaker"
